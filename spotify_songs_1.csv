Jingle Bells,Ella Fitzgerald,"Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh Through the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bob-tail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight Cho: Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh, O Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride And soon Miss Fanny Bright Was seated by my side; The horse was lean and lank Misfortune seemed his lot We ran into a drifted bank And there we got upsot A day or two ago The story I must tell I went out on the snow And on my back I fell; A gent was riding by In a one-horse open sleigh He laughed at me as I there sprawling laid But quickly drove away Now the ground is white Go it while you're young Take the girls along And sing this sleighing song Just bet a bob-tailed bay Two-forty as his speed Hitch him to an open sleigh And crack!

American Pie,Don McLean,"A long, long time ago... I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock 'n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him `Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `Cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken;The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" They were singing Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""",1971,rock

I Was Only Joking,Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a kid in school I messed around with all the rules Apologized, then realized I'm not different after all Me and the boys thought we had it sussed Valentino's all of us My dad said we looked ridiculous But, boy, we broke some hearts In and out of jobs, running free Waging war with society Dumb, blank faces stared back at me But nothing ever changed Promises made in the heat of night Creepin' home before it got too light I wasted all that precious time And blamed it on the wine I was only joking, my dear Looking for a way to hide my fear What kind of fool was I? I could never win Never found a compromise Collected lovers like butterflies Illusions of that grand first prize Are slowly wearin' thin Susie, baby, you were good to me Giving love unselfishly But you took it all too seriously I guess it had to end I was only joking, my dear Looking for a way to hide my fear What kind of fool was I? I could never win Yeah, baby, woo! Now you ask me if I'm sincere That's the question that I always fear Verse seven is never clear But I'll tell you what you want to hear I try to give you all you want But giving love is not my strongest point If that's the case, it's pointless going on I'd rather be alone 'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong Pouring my heart out in a song Owning up for prosperity For the whole damn world to see Quietly now while I turn a page Act one is over without costume change The principal would like to leave the stage The crowd don't understand",1977,rock

Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style But it's always the same in the end They got a divorce as a matter of course And they parted the closest of friends Then the king and the queen went back to the green But you can never go back there again Brenda and Eddie had had it already By the summer of '75 From the high to the low To the end of the show For the rest of their lives They couldn't go back to the Greasers The best they could do was pick up their pieces We always knew they would both find a way to get by That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie Can't tell you more 'cause I told you already And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye Bottle of red, bottle of white Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight I'll meet you anytime you want In our Italian restaurant",1985,rock

I Ain't No Joke,Eric B. & Rakim,"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn But think about it then you'll understand I'm just an addict, addicted to music Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named Another enemy, not even a friend of me'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned Remember me, the one you got your idea from? But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke You can't cope, you should've broke Because I ain't no joke I got a question as serious as cancer Who can keep the average dancer Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling 'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling This is what we all sit down to write You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits Get the style down pat then it's time to switch Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours The E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me So when you see me come up, freeze Or you'll be one of those seven emcees They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that They who think wrong are they who can't do that Style that I'm doing, they might ruin Patterns of paragraphs based on you and Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play Sound familiar, I'll wait till E say Play 'em, so I'mma have to diss and broke You could get a smack for this I ain't no joke I hold the microphone like a grudge B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge I hold a conversation 'cause when I invent I nominated my DJ the president When I emcee I'll keep a freestyle going steadily So pucker up and whistle my melody But whatever you do, don't miss one There'll be another rough rhyme after this one Before you know it, you're following and fiending Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning Like before the moral of my story I'm telling Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling Save it, put it in your pocket for later 'Cause I'm moving the crowd and B'll wreck a fader No interruptions and the mic is broke When I'm gone, then you can joke 'Cause everything is real on a serious tip Keep playing and I get furious quick And I'll take you for a walk through hell Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell Guide you out of triple stage darkness When it get dark again then I'ma spark this Microphone 'cause the heat is on, you see smoke And I'm finished when the beat is gone I'm no joke",1987,rap

Beauty and Madness - 1993,Fra Lippo Lippi,"Over there, just beneath the moon There's a man with a burden to keep Now sleep will fall washout rags n' paper bags Homes and lives passing by Who will see the beauty in your life? And who will be there to hear you when you call? Who will see the madness in your life? And who will be there to catch you if you fall? Now dreams run wild, as lovers find their way Through the night, not a care in the world And over there, over the twinkling of the lights Harbor lights, say goodnight one more time Who will see the beauty in you life? And who will be there to hear you when you call? Who will see the madness in your life? And who will be there to catch you if you fall?",2003,rock

A las Cosas por Su Nombre,Violadores Del Verso,"5 años más tarde... Le quité las telarañas al micro y lo saqué del cofre Y me juré que siempre llamaría a las cosas por su nombre ¿Te haces de cuerpo o de vientre o te estás cagando? Eructo, regoldo, orin es meado y punto Llevamos doble vida Siempre más persona que artista, perdona que te diga Si no queréis sacar dinero en el rap no saquéis disco Cuelga tu promo en internet y listo, so tonto Ni una descarga del mismo del que tanto fardas Y suena psicofonía en una cinta mil veces grabada Llámame para colaborar, MC novato Y lo mejor de tu CD será mi párrafo Me siento solo y con pena Aunque siempre sé la hora En este mi desierto es un gran reloj de arena Hinchado el corazón para bajar la inflamación De esta herida pondréle hielo con ron Soledad es hablar conmigo mismo y preguntarme ¿qué tal el trabajo? ¿Cómo a ido el día? ¿Hoy sales? Y si salgo soledad es hablarle a un litro y llorarle Y bebermelo mezclado con lágrimas y aun así bien me sabe Camareros de etiqueta son mandriles con mandiles Yo tiro cañas a miles, so imbéciles Pude beberme tres cubatas en el mismo vaso Y con los mismos hielos tenía sed, prisa y no tiempo Pongo a Hate en su vida y le hará feliz, le hará reír Y mientras yo solo en una esquina llorando porque síSoy cofrade, beodo y encomendé mi espíritu A San Cacique bendito del amor hermoso No intentéis innovar con tonos raros y la voz De como estuvierais cagando como Dyango¿Qué fue de ese rap hardcore que nos enamoró Cuando Erick Sermon abandonó a EPMD se nos amariconó? Qué triste, ¿no? Mi amor por el rap no nació en un ciber Eres un pufo como las caras de Bélmez o el Ligre Dios me libre de creer en el susodicho Y menos en un cuerpo con sotana negra y un púlpito Ojalá te mueras Este que ahora os habla Nunca sucumbió a modas pasajeras Mi padre es el rap, yo soy su vástago Si no te queda claro, te lo susurro al oído por megáfono ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre Cigarros de la risa son porros Penes son pollas, las vaginas son coños Gobernantes del mundo, son blanco de odio y de ira, normal Yo antes morir, que perder la vida Dios es nada, tú mira al cielo y pide milagros Yo pedí, se me cagó un palomo torcaz por mal cristiano Mierda divina, pensé, y a este infiel concediéronle El ir muriendo de pena, cada vez más cada mes Aun así soy un regalo, sin envoltorio alguno, soy fan de mi grupo Cuando hay disco nuevo en la región a Zaragoza coronamos reina A pesar del aire en movimiento la muy puta ni se despeina Tú qué esperas rapero, un respeto al arquitecto Tú sin mi de que sí yo soy tus cimientos En la oficina de rap sólo se fuma La ley en vigor dicta que no se puede, pero nos la suda Escucha música, de todo pero con criterio Por la muerte de muchos artistas, mi reino A festivales europeos de la música Sho-Hai rechaza Para las Ketchup, gas mostaza Sal de caza y pesca furtivo, jara y sedal O sal de marcha conmigo y será jarra y pedal Amante de lo prohibido, para mí lo más normal A ojos de un purista convencido, pecado mortal Date regalos al cuerpo, joder Pero ponte el capuchón Con la piva que acabas de conocer Te aconsejo lo que debes de hacer Almeja que no se abre no se debe comer Lo que sería el colmo del sumo placer Imagina estornudar y correrte a la vez Aunque un cobarde forero en el tanatorio al mes Sería un placentero trofeo digno de merecer Somos cuatro y el de la guitarra Escupimos lo que pensamos Y no adornamos las palabras con guirnaldas Por su nombre a las cosas: tu relación no funciona Tu pibe te engaña y tu novia es idiota Beber es vivir, pero no lo hagas Mi razón de existir: alegría embotellada Me quiero morir, pero sin deciros nada Diré que bajo a por tabaco y jamás volveré a casa ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre",2006,latin

Tal vez se nos fue el amor Por la puerta en donde entró Quizás en algún descuido Se escapó sin darnos cuenta Definitivo este dolor Que me condena y me lastima Será la suerte quien decida Si me mejoro o me domina Y ya no quiero ser Una hoja de papel Que se escribe día a día Solamente con tu tinta, oh Te digo, mi amor No te pido que traigas flores Tampoco que me des bombones Yo solo quiero una caricia Que me digas que tú me quieres No te pido que te confieses Ni que prometas ni que reces Yo solo quiero que me digas Que no hay mujer que más admiras Ay, ay, ay Viene, viene A mí me da pena contigo Pero es así de sencillo Ganar de nuevo mi afecto Que mi amor ya tiene un precio A mí me da pena contigo No te trasnoches conmigo Sé que nunca fue perfecto Pero mi amor ya tiene un dueño (Otra vez) No te pido que traigas flores Tampoco que me des bombones Yo solo quiero una caricia Que me digas que tú me quieres No te pido que te confieses Ni que prometas ni que reces Yo solo quiero que me digas Que no hay mujer que más admiras A mí me da pena contigo Pero es así de sencillo Ganar de nuevo mi afecto Que mi amor ya tiene un precio A mí me da pena contigo No te trasnoches conmigo Sé que nunca fue perfecto Pero mi amor ya tiene un dueño A mí me da pena contigo Pero es así de sencillo Ganar de nuevo mi afecto Que mi amor ya tiene un precio",2006,latin

Pensando en Ti,Canserbero,"NA ¡Yaoh! Pensando en ti Si, si, ninguna herida sana sin cicatriz Así se derrumbó este amor Como cientos de dominoes en fila Cuando algún dedo al primero derriba Como una casa hecha con cartas alta Hasta que una tormenta sopla su puerta de forma agresiva Como empujar a un niño de un año y medio de vida sin una maldita razón Como un paracaidista que olvidó el paracaídas, así se derrumbó este amor Y ni siquiera porque alguno de los dos quería Si no por no tener un buen detector de mentiras Porque de esa manera, en mi memoria vieras La causa del problema, también la solución Quizás me comprendieras, a menos que creyeras Que no tengo defectos o soy el nuevo Dios De nada sirve recordarte los besos de ojos cerrados Los abrazos y sonrisas del pasado, los sueños trazados Las veces que hemos llorado Por cosas que han pasado y hemos superado Los juegos, los secretos, los momentos contentos, los sobrenombres tiernos Que serían cursis de no ser por esto que sentimos Que nos mantuvo siempre unidos Y en sus tiempos libres hace que el mundo tenga sentido Estoy tan confundido, no sé si llorar Molestarme, o sentarme a pensar, buscarte, o solamente esperar Sigo dudando que en algo sirva rezar Y he llegado a pensar que o Dios no existe o Dios es bipolar Y aquí estaré, con tus fotos en mi memoria Quizás con una nueva novia, pensando en ti El tiempo sana heridas de manera obvia Aunque ninguna herida sana sin dejar cicatriz Quisiera tanto tener la voz de un cantante Para no solo recitar, sino cantarte Pues mi única defensa es explicarte este malentendido Dame otra oportunidad y juro querrás envejecer conmigo Esto es como caminar en círculos por horas Como ver a un gato perseguir su cola Es algo ilógico estar con otra persona y preguntarnos Cómo hubiese sido si te hubieses permitido amarnos Las calles que transito, los lugares que visito La ropa que visto, insisto, todo me hace verte aquí Ayer creí que te vi y al notar que no eras Supe que aunque pueda, no quiero vivir sin ti No te diré que creo que moriré sin ti Porque no creo, no creo, no creo, no creo Tú sabes que soy un guerrero No te diré que no puedo vivir sin ti Porque sí puedo, sí puedo, sí puedo, si puedo Sencillamente es que no quiero Y aquí estaré esperándote, dándome mi puesto Ojalá que cuando rectifiques yo aún esté dispuesto A olvidar el pasado y perdonar que tú no me hayas perdonado Y que no hayas notado que te amo; cuánto te amo Diviértete, vuela muy lejos Que si llegamos a viejos y nos vemos Te diré ""te odio"" después de aspirar tu pelo Y si morimos y hay un cielo, me escaparé del infierno Y te haré el amor en una nube en honor a nuestros recuerdos Mira lo cursi que me has convertido Si esto no es amor entonces soy un loco sin motivo Quiero seguir vivo solo para Algún día decirte en tu cara que aún te amo Aunque aún todo puede ser diferente Si nos juntamos y cambiamos este tema por uno que diga ""Vivieron felices para siempre"" ¡Vivieron felices para siempre!",2010,rock
