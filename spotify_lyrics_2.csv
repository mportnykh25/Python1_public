Hear what I say, hear what I say Makes it all seem hopeless like impending cancellations The locks will open someday continued determination Restless infection destroys spiritual vaccinations And I will head for my destination I stand alone at the crossroads of death inhale the breath Of lost souls that left in and out of consciousness Drinking wine reminds me of what honest is Making me wonder where the hell the logic is?

A las Cosas por Su Nombre,Violadores Del Verso,"5 años más tarde... Le quité las telarañas al micro y lo saqué del cofre Y me juré que siempre llamaría a las cosas por su nombre ¿Te haces de cuerpo o de vientre o te estás cagando? Eructo, regoldo, orin es meado y punto Llevamos doble vida Siempre más persona que artista, perdona que te diga Si no queréis sacar dinero en el rap no saquéis disco Cuelga tu promo en internet y listo, so tonto Ni una descarga del mismo del que tanto fardas Y suena psicofonía en una cinta mil veces grabada Llámame para colaborar, MC novato Y lo mejor de tu CD será mi párrafo Me siento solo y con pena Aunque siempre sé la hora En este mi desierto es un gran reloj de arena Hinchado el corazón para bajar la inflamación De esta herida pondréle hielo con ron Soledad es hablar conmigo mismo y preguntarme ¿qué tal el trabajo? ¿Cómo a ido el día? ¿Hoy sales? Y si salgo soledad es hablarle a un litro y llorarle Y bebermelo mezclado con lágrimas y aun así bien me sabe Camareros de etiqueta son mandriles con mandiles Yo tiro cañas a miles, so imbéciles Pude beberme tres cubatas en el mismo vaso Y con los mismos hielos tenía sed, prisa y no tiempo Pongo a Hate en su vida y le hará feliz, le hará reír Y mientras yo solo en una esquina llorando porque síSoy cofrade, beodo y encomendé mi espíritu A San Cacique bendito del amor hermoso No intentéis innovar con tonos raros y la voz De como estuvierais cagando como Dyango¿Qué fue de ese rap hardcore que nos enamoró Cuando Erick Sermon abandonó a EPMD se nos amariconó? Qué triste, ¿no? Mi amor por el rap no nació en un ciber Eres un pufo como las caras de Bélmez o el Ligre Dios me libre de creer en el susodicho Y menos en un cuerpo con sotana negra y un púlpito Ojalá te mueras Este que ahora os habla Nunca sucumbió a modas pasajeras Mi padre es el rap, yo soy su vástago Si no te queda claro, te lo susurro al oído por megáfono ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre Cigarros de la risa son porros Penes son pollas, las vaginas son coños Gobernantes del mundo, son blanco de odio y de ira, normal Yo antes morir, que perder la vida Dios es nada, tú mira al cielo y pide milagros Yo pedí, se me cagó un palomo torcaz por mal cristiano Mierda divina, pensé, y a este infiel concediéronle El ir muriendo de pena, cada vez más cada mes Aun así soy un regalo, sin envoltorio alguno, soy fan de mi grupo Cuando hay disco nuevo en la región a Zaragoza coronamos reina A pesar del aire en movimiento la muy puta ni se despeina Tú qué esperas rapero, un respeto al arquitecto Tú sin mi de que sí yo soy tus cimientos En la oficina de rap sólo se fuma La ley en vigor dicta que no se puede, pero nos la suda Escucha música, de todo pero con criterio Por la muerte de muchos artistas, mi reino A festivales europeos de la música Sho-Hai rechaza Para las Ketchup, gas mostaza Sal de caza y pesca furtivo, jara y sedal O sal de marcha conmigo y será jarra y pedal Amante de lo prohibido, para mí lo más normal A ojos de un purista convencido, pecado mortal Date regalos al cuerpo, joder Pero ponte el capuchón Con la piva que acabas de conocer Te aconsejo lo que debes de hacer Almeja que no se abre no se debe comer Lo que sería el colmo del sumo placer Imagina estornudar y correrte a la vez Aunque un cobarde forero en el tanatorio al mes Sería un placentero trofeo digno de merecer Somos cuatro y el de la guitarra Escupimos lo que pensamos Y no adornamos las palabras con guirnaldas Por su nombre a las cosas: tu relación no funciona Tu pibe te engaña y tu novia es idiota Beber es vivir, pero no lo hagas Mi razón de existir: alegría embotellada Me quiero morir, pero sin deciros nada Diré que bajo a por tabaco y jamás volveré a casa ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre ”Mago Beodo” os da lo que os corresponde ”Hate” hasta los huevos inconforme ”Yuen Shiao Tien” letras sinceras siempre porque ”Sho Hai” llama las cosas por su nombre",2006

The Waitress Song,Seth Sentry,"Hi, how're you doing?

Pensando en Ti,Canserbero,"NA ¡Yaoh! Pensando en ti Si, si, ninguna herida sana sin cicatriz Así se derrumbó este amor Como cientos de dominoes en fila Cuando algún dedo al primero derriba Como una casa hecha con cartas alta Hasta que una tormenta sopla su puerta de forma agresiva Como empujar a un niño de un año y medio de vida sin una maldita razón Como un paracaidista que olvidó el paracaídas, así se derrumbó este amor Y ni siquiera porque alguno de los dos quería Si no por no tener un buen detector de mentiras Porque de esa manera, en mi memoria vieras La causa del problema, también la solución Quizás me comprendieras, a menos que creyeras Que no tengo defectos o soy el nuevo Dios De nada sirve recordarte los besos de ojos cerrados Los abrazos y sonrisas del pasado, los sueños trazados Las veces que hemos llorado Por cosas que han pasado y hemos superado Los juegos, los secretos, los momentos contentos, los sobrenombres tiernos Que serían cursis de no ser por esto que sentimos Que nos mantuvo siempre unidos Y en sus tiempos libres hace que el mundo tenga sentido Estoy tan confundido, no sé si llorar Molestarme, o sentarme a pensar, buscarte, o solamente esperar Sigo dudando que en algo sirva rezar Y he llegado a pensar que o Dios no existe o Dios es bipolar Y aquí estaré, con tus fotos en mi memoria Quizás con una nueva novia, pensando en ti El tiempo sana heridas de manera obvia Aunque ninguna herida sana sin dejar cicatriz Quisiera tanto tener la voz de un cantante Para no solo recitar, sino cantarte Pues mi única defensa es explicarte este malentendido Dame otra oportunidad y juro querrás envejecer conmigo Esto es como caminar en círculos por horas Como ver a un gato perseguir su cola Es algo ilógico estar con otra persona y preguntarnos Cómo hubiese sido si te hubieses permitido amarnos Las calles que transito, los lugares que visito La ropa que visto, insisto, todo me hace verte aquí Ayer creí que te vi y al notar que no eras Supe que aunque pueda, no quiero vivir sin ti No te diré que creo que moriré sin ti Porque no creo, no creo, no creo, no creo Tú sabes que soy un guerrero No te diré que no puedo vivir sin ti Porque sí puedo, sí puedo, sí puedo, si puedo Sencillamente es que no quiero Y aquí estaré esperándote, dándome mi puesto Ojalá que cuando rectifiques yo aún esté dispuesto A olvidar el pasado y perdonar que tú no me hayas perdonado Y que no hayas notado que te amo; cuánto te amo Diviértete, vuela muy lejos Que si llegamos a viejos y nos vemos Te diré ""te odio"" después de aspirar tu pelo Y si morimos y hay un cielo, me escaparé del infierno Y te haré el amor en una nube en honor a nuestros recuerdos Mira lo cursi que me has convertido Si esto no es amor entonces soy un loco sin motivo Quiero seguir vivo solo para Algún día decirte en tu cara que aún te amo Aunque aún todo puede ser diferente Si nos juntamos y cambiamos este tema por uno que diga ""Vivieron felices para siempre"" ¡Vivieron felices para siempre!",2010
