Jingle Bells,Ella Fitzgerald,"Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh Through the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bob-tail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight Cho: Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh, O Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride And soon Miss Fanny Bright Was seated by my side; The horse was lean and lank Misfortune seemed his lot We ran into a drifted bank And there we got upsot A day or two ago The story I must tell I went out on the snow And on my back I fell; A gent was riding by In a one-horse open sleigh He laughed at me as I there sprawling laid But quickly drove away Now the ground is white Go it while you're young Take the girls along And sing this sleighing song Just bet a bob-tailed bay Two-forty as his speed Hitch him to an open sleigh And crack! You'll take the lead",1960
Winter Wonderland,Aretha Franklin,(Wonderland winter wonderland wonderland) Sleigh bells ring are you listening In the lane snow is glistening A beautiful sight oh we're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is a new bird He's singing a song as we go along Walking in a winter wonderland Well in the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say are you married we say no man But you can do the job when you're in town Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire To face unafraid of the plans that we made Walking in a winter wonderland (In the meadow we can build a snowman) And pretend he's a circus clown We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman Until the other kiddies knock him down Oh when it snows ain't it filling Though your nose gets a chilling We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland (Wonderland wonderland),1964

American Pie,Don McLean,"A long, long time ago... I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock 'n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him `Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `Cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken;The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" They were singing Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""",1971

I Was Only Joking,Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a kid in school I messed around with all the rules Apologized, then realized I'm not different after all Me and the boys thought we had it sussed Valentino's all of us My dad said we looked ridiculous But, boy, we broke some hearts In and out of jobs, running free Waging war with society Dumb, blank faces stared back at me But nothing ever changed Promises made in the heat of night Creepin' home before it got too light I wasted all that precious time And blamed it on the wine I was only joking, my dear Looking for a way to hide my fear What kind of fool was I? I could never win Never found a compromise Collected lovers like butterflies Illusions of that grand first prize Are slowly wearin' thin Susie, baby, you were good to me Giving love unselfishly But you took it all too seriously I guess it had to end I was only joking, my dear Looking for a way to hide my fear What kind of fool was I? I could never win Yeah, baby, woo! Now you ask me if I'm sincere That's the question that I always fear Verse seven is never clear But I'll tell you what you want to hear I try to give you all you want But giving love is not my strongest point If that's the case, it's pointless going on I'd rather be alone 'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong Pouring my heart out in a song Owning up for prosperity For the whole damn world to see Quietly now while I turn a page Act one is over without costume change The principal would like to leave the stage The crowd don't understand",1977

I Ain't No Joke,Eric B. & Rakim,"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn But think about it then you'll understand I'm just an addict, addicted to music Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named Another enemy, not even a friend of me'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned Remember me, the one you got your idea from? But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke You can't cope, you should've broke Because I ain't no joke I got a question as serious as cancer Who can keep the average dancer Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling 'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling This is what we all sit down to write You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits Get the style down pat then it's time to switch Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours The E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me So when you see me come up, freeze Or you'll be one of those seven emcees They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that They who think wrong are they who can't do that Style that I'm doing, they might ruin Patterns of paragraphs based on you and Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play Sound familiar, I'll wait till E say Play 'em, so I'mma have to diss and broke You could get a smack for this I ain't no joke I hold the microphone like a grudge B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge I hold a conversation 'cause when I invent I nominated my DJ the president When I emcee I'll keep a freestyle going steadily So pucker up and whistle my melody But whatever you do, don't miss one There'll be another rough rhyme after this one Before you know it, you're following and fiending Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning Like before the moral of my story I'm telling Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling Save it, put it in your pocket for later 'Cause I'm moving the crowd and B'll wreck a fader No interruptions and the mic is broke When I'm gone, then you can joke 'Cause everything is real on a serious tip Keep playing and I get furious quick And I'll take you for a walk through hell Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell Guide you out of triple stage darkness When it get dark again then I'ma spark this Microphone 'cause the heat is on, you see smoke And I'm finished when the beat is gone I'm no joke",1987
